Hi! My name is Ryan Armstrong and Iâ€™m a senior engineer for an IT out-sourcing company based in
Perth, Western Australia, currently posted on the Tools and Automation team (see DevOps/Apps) for a
government agency. I also contribute to an IoT start-up in London in my *"spare"* time.

I get excited like a little girl around data centre automation and performance tuning. I currently
spend most of my days working on a big deployment of Zabbix enterprise monitoring (4000+ servers)
and a fledgling deployment of Puppet Enterprise.

You'll here me bang on about DevOps, Agile and Free and Open Source Software from time to time.

I believe in learning and building on the efforts of others and contributing back in a meaningful
way.

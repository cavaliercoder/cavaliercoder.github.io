Hi! My name is Ryan Armstrong and I’m a senior engineer for an IT out-sourcing company based in
Perth, Western Australia, currently posted on the Tools and Automation team (see DevOps/Apps) for a
government agency.

I’m an enthusiast for cutting-edge IT methodologies and toolsets, particularly in the DevOps and
automation arenas.

I believe in building on the efforts of others and contributing back.

I’m an open source evangelist. I’m a console nerd. I’m a perfectionist and an innovator.

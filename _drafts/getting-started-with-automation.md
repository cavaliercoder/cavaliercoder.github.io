title:  "Getting started with automation"
---

The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) released a [report in
June 2015](http://www.ceda.com.au/research-and-policy/policy-priorities/workforce)
which emphasised their prediction that 40% of Australian jobs will be replaced
by automation within the next ten to twenty years.

Examining emerging sentiments in the SysAdmin/ITOps communities, it seems that
traditional system administration jobs are likely to make up a part of the array
of jobs which dwindle into obscurity.

This appears to be born out of the maturity of DevOps style practices and the
blistering acceleration of easily available, open source automation projects
which out perform and out innovate traditional enterprise vendor offerings.

These practices and platforms, which include Continuous Deployment, Containers,
Software Defined Datacentres, etc. sum up to a single outcome:

Businesses can deliver faster, more reliably and at larger scales, but
__with less people__.

For example, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=177577963919)
and Google are able to develop, deploy and support miriad applications, with
world class reliability using a ratio of one engineer for every several million
users. In the enterprise world of IT delivery, typically this ratio is closer to
50 users per engineer.

This article is intended to encourage thought and discussion on how to close the
gap by driving automation insteading of spectating.

## The Utopia

The Silicon Valley Unicorns have the advantage of riding year on year growth and
leveraging a limitless pool of talent. This means they can answer most problems
simply by getting the right people on the bus and getting out of their way. This
isn't a reality for businesses trying to make the transition from operational
fire-fighting to autonomous, scale-out service delivery.

In a Utopian transition, the strategic heads tell everyone to 'start automating'
and everyone gets to work building the autonomous, intelligent robots of
tomorrow. You might as well ask a fish to climb a tree.

They:
* Build hierarchies around the value, not the other way around
* Focus on adding value back to the system


## Step 1: Observe

The worst thing you could possibly do, is make a snap decision and implement a
poorly understood idea from the online store of fads, frameworks and
fallacies. If you have decided to become a Lean, or DevOps or Agile or ITIL
organisation without truly understanding the problems you face and how these
ideas will give you a targeted solution, this is a serious red flag. Stop!

You need divine clarity on why you aren't already ahead of the curve and what
you need to do to get there. This takes time, heated internal arguments and
worst of all, unashamed humility.

So get started:

* Get in the trenches and observe behaviors
* Be 'value' focussed and question everything you see in terms of its
  contribution toward business goals and values
* Root out unknown quantities - make sure everything important is measurable

Most importantly, don't make changes yet.

Instead, you need to thoroughly understand the problems facing your business.

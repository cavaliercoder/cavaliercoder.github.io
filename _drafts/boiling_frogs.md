## Pg. 2

> ...changes may need to be considered together to achieve systemic improvement
rather than localised changes.

> Part of the point of embracing this kind of change is that there isn’t an end
state because change is constant.

## Pg. 3

> In order to maintain competitive advantage, old ways of working for our
more predictable solutions are no longer appropriate when we need to create new value by
working on speculative, creative solutions.

## Pg. 5

> The story goes that if a frog is placed in a saucepan of cold water, which is
slowly heated, the frog adapts its body temperature to the changing heat of the
water and gradually goes to sleep. In fact, it goes to sleep at 40 ᵒC, unaware
that at 100 ᵒC it boils alive. However, if the frog is placed in already boiling
water it immediately jumps out to safety.

> This is a useful metaphor to illustrate that although humans think they are
very clever at adapting to the changing world, they don’t necessarily recognise
the need to jump out of that world and take charge of it, not just adapt to it.
There is a risk of being blissfully unaware that the world is changing so
dramatically that there is danger of boiling alive whilst asleep.

## Pg. 6

> The technological environment is now moving too quickly for us to take years
building big solutions.


## Pg. 7

> Creation of a high number of roles, job descriptions, process and structures
that are organised around the way we've *provided* value not the actual *value*
that we provide.

> Organisation of people around existing products, capabilities and process, not
by the skill & expertise they provide.

>  ...focusing on inward pressures and thinking about how to improve the things
we currently do, rather than the value we need to provide. This is why so many
people miss the need to change radically.

## Pg. 9

> To survive rapid disruption technical businesses and organisations need to do
less of some of the “old” ways of working and move towards doing more of the
“new” ways of working...

## Pg. 12

> [on process handoffs] ...This kind of structured process is a primary
impediment to business agility in many organisations, effectively negating any
benefits of agility gained by product delivery teams. 

> Attempting to apply a single form of working (e.g. classic Project Management
or Emergent Agile Architecture) across all areas, as a single predefined
structure simply does not work.

> It is much better to allow project teams to form structure temporarily to suit
the group’s needs rather than having automatically invoked predefined
structures.

> Forward leaning organisations need less structure not more. You don’t make
work faster, better, cheaper or happier by adding more layers of management.

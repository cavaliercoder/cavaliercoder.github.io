## Core message

SysAdmins can and should use Source Control to manage Puppet


## Key concepts:

* SysAdmins can handle code and source control
* Use source control and r10k
* use packaging instead of building


## Address problems:

* quickly, why use Puppet (the machine, method, measure, robot vs steam, error checking, idempotency, reporting, source tracing, etc.)
* What should I Puppetize first? (what *can't* be done in Puppet?)
* Configure r10k-control
* roles/profiles and ENC
* Move through dev/test/prod (vagrant?)
* Delegate permissions to different teams
* Isolate development branches
* Stage deployments
* Trace changes back to the source
* Roll back vs roll forward

Analogy: Incremental backups?
  * Only the difference is stored


Choosing VCS tool? Make sure it is distributed

Where to store passwords?

How to layout roles/profiles? (use GitHub as a reference)



## VCS Benefits:
* It's not "Infrastructure-As-Copy-And-Paste"
* Backup, audit trail, error prevention, deployment, isolation of work, change
  log, resolve conflicts, definitive versioning

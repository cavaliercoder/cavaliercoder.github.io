## Core message

SysAdmins can and should use Source Control to manage Puppet


## Key concepts:

* SysAdmins can handle code and source control
* Use source control and r10k
* use packaging instead of building
* End on: Imagine you solve the orgs biggest bottleneck in a preproducable, automated, measurable and portable way.

## Agenda:
* 

## Address problems:

* quickly, why use Puppet (the machine, method, measure, robot vs steam, error checking, idempotency, reporting, source tracing, etc.)
* What should I Puppetize first? (what *can't* be done in Puppet?)
* Configure r10k-control
* roles/profiles and ENC
* Move through dev/test/prod (vagrant?)
* Delegate permissions to different teams
* Isolate development branches
* Stage deployments
* Trace changes back to the source
* Roll back vs roll forward
* Use packaging instead of automated compiles

## Angles?
* Rule 1: Use source control, Rule 2: See rule 1
* Source control = Back to the Future
* Puppet = Hammer, Nail gun, 3d Printer
* Config drift = "Ryan Special"
* Contribute to the product - PostgreSQL Module

Start with the story of when I started out

Share twitter handle


Analogy: Incremental backups?
  * Only the difference is stored


Choosing VCS tool? Make sure it is distributed

Where to store passwords? (eyaml)

How to layout roles/profiles? (use GitHub as a reference)



## VCS Benefits:
* It's not "Infrastructure-As-Copy-And-Paste" - .baks files, 
* Backup, audit trail, error prevention, deployment, isolation of work, change
  log, resolve conflicts, definitive versioning


Show twitter


## Tips
* Run it by natalie
* Have a discussion, don't give a speech
* Ensure it has "tweetables"
* Be vulerable and show weakness
* Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories (SUCCES)
* 1 - 2 sentence message. stress a single point instead of ten
* Tell them what you're going to say, say it, and tell 'em what you said
* Pictures, no words
* Make sure they ask questions on twitter
* tell a story, even if it's educational
* What do they want to hear?
* Come out strong with something personal and funny. 30 seconds
* No need for who am I and KIT
* Use history somehow... how have we made changes like this before???
* Minimalist slides with intersting fonts
* Pause and think about questions
* Keep it on time
* Remember the previous speakers have bigger deployments!
* don't be gloomy about the challenges
* MInimize and cut the fat
* don't read from notes... get out from behind the podium

* use the little red hen analogy?

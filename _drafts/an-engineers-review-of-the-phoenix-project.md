title:  "An engineers review of 'The Phoenix Project'"
---

First half is incredibly frustrating. I image the three authors in a poorly lit
room, maliciously potting the perfect torture to push Bill to mental breakdown.
It's basically the inverse of deus ex machina. When it can't get any worse, some
unforeseeable miraculous perfect storm of effluence comes raining down.

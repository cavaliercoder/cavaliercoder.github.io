I'm finally recovering from jet lag after landing home from Zabbix Conference
2016 in Riga, Latvia. My good mate and colleague, James Cook and I had the
pleasure of attending the conference this year to discover what's new with
Zabbix, how others are making use of it, and most importantly, to meet and greet
with the superb team at Zabbix SIA HQ.

After my talk at [Perth DevOps Meetup]({% post_url 2016-05-26-monitoring-6000-hosts-in-zabbix %}),
Zabbix were kind enough to ask me to give a similar presentation at the
conference. You can [download a PDF copy here]({{ "/2016-09-18-zabbix-conference-2016/slides.pdf" | prepend: site.cdnurl }}).

My talk covered a little about Kinetic IT and our client, the WA Department of
Education. I then described some of the automation tools we have written to
turn Zabbix into a fairly autonomous monitoring system. Finally I gave a
demonstration of a selection of the automation tools that I have released or
rewritten for open source.

Please also, check out the talks for all the other speakers at the
[Zabbix Conference 2016 homepage](http://www.zabbix.com/conf2016_agenda.php).

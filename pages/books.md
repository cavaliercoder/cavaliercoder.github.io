I have had the great privilege of being mentored by world class people like Jim
Collins, Eric Ries, Jez Humble, Jim Whitehurst, Patrick Lencioni, Kernighan and
Ritchie, folks from the Google SRE team and many more leaders in business and
IT operations through their elaborate and refined writings.

To me, the best measure of a book is whether it changes the way I think. The
books in this list (in no particular order) are those which have had such an
effect on me, as both an IT professional, and as a person.

If you read any of these, please leave some thoughts in the comment section
below.

## Thinking in Systems

By Donella H. Meadows

Everything is connected, across time and space. Donella beautifully illustrates
a number of different systems "Animals" - common patterns that appear in
air-conditioner thermostats, the art of steering a car on the road and
distributed computing systems. This book taught me to prefer small, calculated
moves over wholesale systems changes and to better interpret and respond to
measurements over time.

## Lean Enterprise

By Jez Humble, Joanne Molesky and Barry O'Reilly

When an IT organization gets large enough, the need for predictability and
stability starts to stifle innovation until fast moving, unencumbered startups
disrupt them.

Lean Enterprise provides a prescriptive process and plenty of follow up reading
to enable large organizations to overcome "inertia" while minimizing cost and
risk. The business is divided into three horizons where first, exploration and
experimentation take place. Experiments that prove to deliver value are
transitioned into the 'Exploitation' horizon where an MVP is quickly transformed
into a sustainable product. Finally, the 'Stabilization' horizon focuses on
efficiency and stability; keeping the lights on so new experimentation can get
underway.

By Jim Whitehurst

It's no secret I'm a big believer in the power of Free and Open Source Software
and open source communities. This book offers an inside look at RedHat's success
as the largest open source vendor in the world, from the perspective of their
C.E.O., Jim Whitehurst.

Jim explores how RedHat leverage the power of internal and external communities
to build the world class software products that run the New York Stock Exchange
and countless other high profile enterprises.

What I found most interesting was RedHat's adoption of a meritocracy; where
community members and their contributions are evaluated on their merits, not
their title or pay grade. This has changed the way I take on ideas from my
colleagues and has also encouraged me to participate in discussions outside my
remit.


## Made to Stick

By Chip Heath and Dan Heath

Ever wondered why the latest company strategy is not getting any traction? Why
your marketing pitch is falling on deaf ears? Why even clear, concise facts are
not enough to persuade people to your way of thinking?

_Made to Stick_ answers these questions in a common-sense manner that has
profoundly changed the way I communicate. It offers a very simple checklist (the
_SUCCESs_ model) to apply to your own communications to ensure they will be
understood, memorable and influence people's thinking.

I've found this book particularly useful in presenting my ideas for new
projects, and in writing for my blog.


## The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

By Patrick Lencioni

From the teams on the service desk to the executives and the board, nothing is
more critical to the success of a business than effective teamwork. In _The Five
Dysfunctions of a Team_, Patrick Lencioni illustrates the reforming of an
executive team using a simple, five tier model which highlights the most common
obstacles to being affective as a team.

For me it highlighted some common sense cause and effect in interpersonal and
inter-team politics in my own workplace. Where I might have previously strived
to encourage people to focus on business outcomes and results, I learned we
first need to create a culture of accountability, which first needs unanimous
commitment towards common goals, which first needs constructive conflict to take
place, which first requires people to trust one another enough to feel
vulnerable.


## The Phoenix Project

By Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford

This book is the de facto entry point for anyone interested in understanding
DevOps. What I love most, is that it is a management parable, not another
inapplicable implementation of Continuous Delivery or Infrastructure As Code.

_The Phoenix Project_ is a very deliberate homage to [The Goal](#the-goal) and
is written in a very similar style, adapted for modern IT audiences. It
incorporates elements of The Goal's Theory of Constraints, Lean manufacturing,
[Toyota Kata](#toyota-kata), Agile and Continuous Delivery into a DevOps
management recipe and way of thinking.

It focuses primarily on helping the business achieve its goals using IT as a
core competency, rather than focussing on the Dev/Ops relationship and
automation tools. It helped me to focus and realign my day-to-day activities to
those that can be directly linked to successful outcomes for the business as a
whole.

By Eliyahu M. Goldratt

For a parable written in the 1984 concerning manufacturing plants, the
application of _The Goal_ to modern IT development and operations is incredibly
potent and is expanded on further in
[The Phoenix Project](#the-phoenix-project).

This book has really helped me to identify where to (and where not to) invest my
time and energy, especially concerning IT automation and process improvement.

I've written a full review in
[The Goal: A challenge to IT Operations]({% post_url 2015-12-12-the-goal %})

## Toyota Kata

By Mike Rother

Almost every "improvement" initiative I have ever participated in could be
described as an "implementation" of a known methodology. We implement Scrum or
Lean or war rooms or silo crushing meetings or Continuous Delivery, etc., etc.,
etc..

Sometimes the implementations are successful (I.e. a well run Scrum team) but
don't actually benefit the business in any tangible or profitable way and even
moderately successful implementations tend to degrade very quickly.

Mike Rother takes a look inside Toyota's successful Continuous Improvement
culture to show why people who copy Toyota's process _implementations_ typically
cannot emulate Toyota's success.

Toyota's Lean processes are actually an evolution, more explicitly, an adaption
to change, specific to their needs and environment. This book explores _how_
Toyota approaches changes and develops improvements. Their way of thinking and
"Improvement Kata" can be applied almost universally; including in IT.

This book has helped me to bake Continuous Improvement into every action I take,
rather than approaching it as sporadic and typically unsuccessful projects.


## Who Moved My Cheese?

By Spencer Johnson M.D

It only took roughly an hour to read this profound little parable from cover to
cover. _Who Moved My Cheese_ follows four little creatures, Sniff, Scurry, Hem
and Haw, who navigate their way through a maze searching for _Cheese_, an
analogy for the things that make us happy. Most importantly, it explores how
each character reacts to changes in the maze and the location of their Cheese.

Change is inevitable in our lives, and especially in IT. This book offers some
simple ideas, expressed as _Handwriting on the wall_ of the maze, for how to
identify, cope with and adapt to change effectively.

I identify most with the character _Sniff_. I tend to sniff out change and
typically get excited by it. This book has helped me to better understand that
others approach change differently and that being a "forward thinker" can
actually be perceived as threatening.

I'm making a point of reading this regularly to make sure I don't get trapped in
the arrogance of success or miss the writing on the wall when my comfort zones
start to change.


## The C Programming Language
<a href="http://amzn.com/0131103628" target="_blank">

</a>
By Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie

Not a programmer? Doesn't matter. The concepts in this book and the tutorials
will be a real challenge for a first time programmer and you may even give up.
In fact, I did give up. But I came back a few years later and conquered it
cover to cover.

As a Sysadmin, it's important to understand the difference between the heap and
the stack, what a pointer is, what shared memory is for, how memory gets
allocated and corrupted, how memory leaks happen, how code patterns affect
performance and capacity, how shared libraries are really used, what stack
traces mean, etc..

If you can grok this book, all of these concepts become much clearer and you'll
even be able to build small tools of your own, participate better in open source
communities and communicate with developers in a common tongue.


## Good to Great

</a>
By Jim Collins

Good to Great is probably the most thoroughly researched and well presented
work I have ever encountered. Jim Collins dissects the differenciators between
companies which outperform the market consistently over fifteen years to those
that don't. The findings are often counter-intuitive but are very well
established in the presented facts.

Jim condenses everything down into a tangible framework called *The Flywheel*
which offers stepping stones to replicating the success of the Great companies.

One stage of the flywheel, *The Hedgehog Concept* complements the idea presented
in [Made to Stick](#made-to-stick) that succinct, unidirectional strategies are
most effective at enabling a company to move forward in unison.

A later stage, *First Who, Then What* emphasises that "getting the right people
on the bus" is the first and most critical part of building a successful
company. This idea is echoed as the *First Key* in
[First, Break All the Rules](#first-break-all-the-rules).

I'd strongly recommend anyone read this book as it offers a great sense of
context around organisational success. More importantly however, the principals
of a *Level Five Leader* should be taken on board by team members at any level
of experience or title.

By Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman

This book brings together the findings from interviews with more than 80,000
successful managers to find out what makes them so effective.

The following keys are found to be consistent across most of the managers who
took part in the study:

* They hire for talent and understand the recurring thoughts, feelings and
  behaviors that are needed on their team
* They define clear and valuable outcomes and leave the implementation to their
  employees
* They focus on developing strengths instead of trying to fix weaknesses
* They work to fit people where they belong and can succeed

I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to move into a management or
leadership role, anyone looking to expand their team, hoping to land on the
right hire, or anyone hoping to understand why their current org-structure is
letting them down.

Edited by Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones, Jennifer Petoff and Niall Richard Murphy.

This book collects essays from key members of Google's SRE teams that build,
deploy, monitor and maintain Google's large scale production systems. The essays
cover the philosophies, processes, architectures, mantras and mistakes that
enable Google to be so successful.

Many of the lessons are directly applicable to much smaller scale IT service
providers, like their incident response procedures, on-call rostering and
philosophies concerning risk management and eliminating low value "toil".

Other lessons were less applicable, but equally interesting, such as the
design challenges of distributed consensus systems, automated deployment and
data processing pipelines.

I'd recommend this book to engineers and operations managers in any IT org. It's
a real privilege to be able to learn from the refined and battle hardened

practices of some of the world's most talented operators.
